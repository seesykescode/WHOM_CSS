# WHOM_CSS

Just a shot at recreating Frank Stella's [WHOM (single)](https://www.lacma.org/art/exhibition/frank-stella-selections-permanent-collection).

Sizing of squares is off and will need to be worked on at some point, but since it was in my head since I visited LACMA last month...finally decided to give it a shot.
